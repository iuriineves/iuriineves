## About me
I'm currently studying Sciences and Technology at my local high school. Right now, I'm 17 years old, and set to finish high school by 2025.
I can fluently speak Portuguese, my mother tongue, as well as English. Interested in learning more languages in the future!

Also a big sucker for music, art, and physics.

## How I got into computers


I've always been quite impatient with achieving my dreams, so I started studying computers at the age of 13. That's where my journey started, 2019.
My mind has always wondered how websites, apps and games were made. To be honest, I was never great at any games my friends and I enjoyed to play, so I guess making them would be the best course of action. I have worked on several small projects, some of which you can see on my profile. Anything I can thinker with is my heaven on earth.
  
The way computers work for me is almost like magic. However, this magic has always been so intuitive to me that it feels like a necessity to build some of it. I hope anything I do here on GitHub helps you in any way, either it be through one of my repos, or something as simple as a contribution fixing a typo on your favourite npm package!

## What I know and what I'm learning

As I said above, I've taught myself python, which was my first programming language. Since then, I've thinkered with Java, C#, C++, and currently I'm learning Javascript alongside ReactJS, NextJS, and all things front-end related.
Besides this, I've worked with Numworks' calculator, being somewhat familiar with their version of micropython. Other than some Minecraft mods and some webpages/webapps, my learning path is still a long way to go.
However, my passion for digital stuff doesn't stop there. I love desiging mockups on figma, drawing logos on illustrator, even make posters on photoshop. Being so bad at games also made me focus on making them, which led me to pixelart and music production.
