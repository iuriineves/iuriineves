## üë§ About me
Hello and welcome to my github profile! My name is I√∫ri Neves, and I'm a 18 year old computer engineering student at ______.
Currently, I speak two languages fluently, Portuguese and English. I hope you like my stuff!

Oh, I also love reading whenever I'm not lazy enough to pick a book up! Check out my [goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/iuriineves) if you're interested on what I've been reading.

## üñ•Ô∏è How I got into computers

As most Gen Z-ers do, to be honest: playing games. I remember playing Formula One 06 on the PS2 with my father, though I was terrible at it.
From there, I played a variety of games on the PS2, PS3, and eventually on the family computer. Rest in peace Club Penguin. However, I always had a very strict technology time limit at home (how ironic), so I never had the chance to get good at any games me and my friends played. This led me to being more interested about the idea of a game rather than actually playing it.

At the same time, I was always that kid who would disassemble everything they laid their hands on. I've lost so many ball point pen springs this way. Naturally, this paved the way for my interest on understanding how technology works inside, not only from a hardware standpoint, but from a software standpoint as well.

I can't tell if I'm really passionate or just very anxious, but all I know is that I wasn't patient enough to wait for a proper education on computer engineering, so I started programming at the age of 13. At 15, I made my first [public repository](https://github.com/iuriineves/NIL). I didn't stop there, though.

Since then, I've participated as a tutor on a robotics class at my school and programmed arduino circuits, made websites, shipped a [Minecraft mod](https://github.com/iuriineves/sn0wfrogs-capybaras) with over 50k downloads, designed and created multiple websites using NextJS, and of course, made games using the Godot engine. 

I really hope to be able to continue pursuing this passion, not only as a professional but as an hobbyist (I'm looking at you AI), as well as leave a mark on open source projects. This is why I'm on github after all!

## üìí What I know and what I'm learning

My first programming language was Python (shocker, I know), which i taught myself at 13 with the help of the Internet. Since then, I've learnt a bit of Java and C++, but I'm most comfortable in Javascript. I hope to learn a lot more, that being the reason I'm studying at ______. Thanks for reading!
