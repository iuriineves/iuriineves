## üë§ About me  
Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile!  
My name is I√∫ri Neves, and I‚Äôm an 18-year-old computer engineering student at **[STILL WAITING TO KNOW MY UNIVERSITY]**.  
I speak two languages fluently: Portuguese and English. I hope you enjoy my work!

Oh, and I love reading, when I‚Äôm not too lazy to pick up a book. Feel free to check out my [Goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/iuriineves) to see what I‚Äôve been reading lately.

## üñ•Ô∏è How I got into computers  

Like most Gen Z-ers, through gaming. I remember playing *Formula One 06* on the PS2 with my dad, though I was awful at it.  
From there, I moved on to all kinds of games on the PS2, PS3, and eventually the family PC (Rest in peace, Club Penguin).

Due to strict screen time limits at home (how ironic), I never had much chance to ‚Äúget good‚Äù at any of the games my friends were into.  
Instead, I started getting more interested in *how* games worked than just playing them.

I was also that kid who disassembled everything they touched (many ballpoint pen springs were lost in the process).  
Naturally, this curiosity turned into a desire to understand how technology works, both hardware and software.

I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm really passionate or just very anxious, but I wasn't able to wait around for a formal education to start coding.  
At 13, I taught myself to program. At 15, I made my first [public repository](https://github.com/iuriineves/NIL). I haven‚Äôt stopped since.

Since then, I‚Äôve:
- tutored a robotics class at my school  
- programmed Arduino circuits  
- built and deployed websites  
- shipped a [Minecraft mod](https://github.com/iuriineves/sn0wfrogs-capybaras) with over 50k downloads  
- designed and launched multiple websites using Next.js  
- made games using the Godot engine  

I hope to keep pursuing this passion, both professionally and as a hobby (AI, I‚Äôm watching you) and leave my mark on the open-source world.  
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here on GitHub!

## üìí What I know and what I‚Äôm learning  

My first programming language was Python (shocking, I know), which I taught myself at 13 with the help of the Internet.  
Since then, I‚Äôve picked up some Java and C++, but I feel most comfortable with JavaScript.  

I'm always looking to expand my skills, which is exactly why I'm studying at **[HOPEFULLY NOVA FCT]**.  
Thanks for reading!
